    <h3>About</h3>

    <h3>South Carolina Seismic Network</h3>

    <p>
    The SCSN was founded in 1974 by Pradeep Talwani at USC and collaborators at the
    US Geological Survey. The 1886 Charleston Earthquake demonstrated that
    substantial earthquake hazards exist in the region. The SCSN operates a
    small network of seismographs throughout the state to monitor continuing
    seismicity in the region.
    We partner with
    <a href="https://www.memphis.edu/ceri/seismic/index.php">
    The Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI)</a>, the
    authoritative network for locating earthquakes in the southeastern US
    and with the
    <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/anss-advanced-national-seismic-system">
    USGS Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS). </a> All data generated by
    the SCSN is available from <a href="https://www.iris.edu/hq/">Earthscope</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Dr. Talwani retired in 2009 and the SCSN was under the direction of
    Dr. Tom Owens until his retirement in 2022. Dr. Scott White was director from
    2022-2024. Dr. Dan Frost is the current
    director. Dr. Philip Crotwell is the network manager.
    </p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards">USGS Earthquake Hazards Program</a></h3>
        The USGS is responsible for monitoring earthquakes and related hazards
        within the US and globally. They maintain the official catalog of all
        earthquakes.
        The South Carolina Seismic Network is a regional network within the
        <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/anss-advanced-national-seismic-system">
          USGS Advanced National Seismic System
        </a>
        and all data collected is shared in near real time with them.

          Center for Earthquake Research and Information
        </a></h3>
        CERI at the University
        of Memphis is our primary regional partner. We submit continuous data to them
        that is used to detect and locate earthquakes within the southeastern
        US. They are considered the authoritative regional network and are
        responsible for submitting earthquake locations to the USGS.

        EarthScope supports research in the geosciences and is the primary data archive
        for seismic data, supporting seismology research in the US. The SCSN
        shares all data collected in near real time with EarthScope.
