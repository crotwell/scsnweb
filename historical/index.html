      <h3>Historical Earthquakes around South Carolina</h3>
      <h5>The 1886 Charleston earthquake and Summerville</h5>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/ushis251/impact">
        August 31, 1886 earthquake near Charleston</a> is the most damaging
        event in the Southeastern US in recorded history, with an estimated
        magnitude above 7 and the epicenter was likely near Middleton Place.
        Small earthquakes in this area near Summerville, SC are routinely detected
        and are likely related to the same fault system as the 1886 earthquake.
      </p>
      <h5>The Eastern Piedmont Fault System</h5>
      <p>
        The Eastern Piedmont Fault System runs from Alabama to Virginia
        and crosses the midlands of South Carolina. Many earthquakes in
        South Carolina are thought to be on this structure, including the
        2021-2026 swarm near Lugoff and Elgin.
      </p>
      <h5>2021-2026 Swarm near Lugoff and Elgin</h5>
      <p>
        On Dec 27, 2021, the first of over a
        <a href="elginswarm.html">hundred earthquakes</a> in an area
        near Lugoff and Elgin occurred. Within this swarm there have been
        5 earthquakes with magnitude greater than 3 and many of the smaller
        ones have been felt by residents of the area. This swarm is
        associated with the Eastern Piedmont Fault System and as of January 2026
        the earthquakes are continuing, although at a reduced rate and size.
      </p>
      <h5>Reservoir Induced Seismicity</h5>
      <p>
        The impounding of artificial lakes and reservoirs is known to cause
        small earthquakes in the vicinity. These tend to be small and close to
        the reservoir. The activity is most intense in the months following
        the filling of the reservoir, but may continue sporadically for years.
        Notable examples include around
        Lake Strom Thurmond (Clarks Hill Lake) on the Georgia border,
        lakes Jocassee and Keowee in the northwest corner,
        and the Monticello reservoir in the center of the state.
      </p>
      <h5>General Seismicity</h5>
      <p>
        All areas of South Carolina have seen earthquakes at one time or another.
        These include the magnitude 1912 magnitude 4.8 earthquake near Charleston,
        the 1913 magnitude 4.3 in Union County ,
        the 1959 mannitude 4.4 near Sangaree SC,
        the 1972 magnitude 4.3 near Bowman,
        the 1974 magnitude 4.7 near Ladson,
        the 1992 magnitude 4.1 near Centerville,
        and the 2014 magnitude 4.1 Edgefield County event.
